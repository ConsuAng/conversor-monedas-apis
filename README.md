# APIs evaluation projetc

The purpose of this project was to evaluate how to use APIs learned in classes. This project is a HTML currency converter, here you convert CLP to another economic indicator that you chose.

Also with the currency converting it should display a chart showing the change of the currency value through time.

In this project the web page was build with HTML and CSS files. For the functionality, I use JavaScript. You can find the logic and the functions in the js file.
